# WindowWander
Your windows are now free to wander the screen space, you're welcome. 

WIP:
Currently wander.py supports no usage modes, execution parameters, or env keyword arguments. 

Features:
Will spawn a chrome window containing a gif of a large cat falling over. Will wander the screen using the drunkard's walk algorithm, a simple symmetric random walk on a locally finite lattice topology.
